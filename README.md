# Scientific-Calculator-built-with-html-css-js

### Making a Casio scientific calculator from scratch with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript as a web project.

## Description
This web project aims to simulate the operation and features of a real calculator. It was created for self-improving skills in JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. The front-end design is inspired by a Casio calculator, implementing most of its functions with additional features like sound effects and background customization. However, some functions remain a work in progress due to their complexity. All contributions are appreciated.
